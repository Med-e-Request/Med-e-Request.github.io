    <b> 1.	Introduction </b> 
    <br>
    <p> The application med-E-request, and the developer Chloe Royston (‘the Developer’) respects the privacy of every person using the med-E-request application (‘the App’).  We will comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations. This privacy policy sets out the Developer’s approach towards the use of personal information. </p>

    <br>
    The App can only be used by health care professionals. Medical practices, on behalf of the health care professionals who wish to use the App (the users), will register with Google’s Firebase. The practice will then provide each health care professional with a username and password to access the App. Users are referred to Google Firebase's privacy policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy. </p>

    <p> med-E-request creates automated booking forms via PDF that can be sent using Mac Mail.  The App is designed for the exclusive use of healthcare professionals within South Africa.  
    <br> We therefore facilitate a secure and efficient booking and investigation request system that creates PDF request forms using data from health care professionals.  We do not collect, store or process any of this information, and we cannot access it. </p>

    <br>
    <p> med-E-request is designed to collect no personal information.  Users will require a username and password to access and use the App, but we do not store, collect or process any personal information – Google’s Firebase will store the usernames and passwords of authorized healthcare professionals, and medical practices will sign up with the Google’s Firebase on behalf of authorized users. 
    <br> The App complies with all applicable data protection legislation, including the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (‘POPIA’). </p>
    <br>
    
    <b> 5.	Sharing information with others: third party access </b> 
    <br>
    <p> med-E-request will under no circumstances ever sell your personal information, and med-E-request will not share your information with any third party, other than those described in this section. In order to facilitate the automated booking requests provided by the App, med-E-request is powered by Google’s Firebase Backend-as-a-Service and Apple’s Mac Mail – the privacy policy for Firebase is https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy. </p>

    <b> 6.	Personal information about children and special personal information </b> 
    <br>
    <p> med-E-request does not collect personal information about children.  
    <br> med-E-request does not collect or store any “special personal information” as defined in POPIA, which includes for example political, religious or health-related information. </p>
    <br>

    <b> 7.	Data retention/deletion policies </b> 
    <br>
    <p> As set out above, we do not collect, process or store any personal data, and in the event a user would like to request deletion of their username, that request should be sent to the user’s medical practice, with a copy sent to mederequest@gmail.com and we will follow up with the medical practice and ensure the username is removed from the Firebase database.
    <br> In the event you have any queries or concerns regarding data privacy, please contact us the e-mail address above.  </p>
    <br>
    
    <b> 8.	Changes to this policy  </b> 
    <br>
    <p> We may amend this policy from time-to-time, and will advise users of any changes via the App. </p>
