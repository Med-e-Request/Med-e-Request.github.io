    <p> The App can only be used by health care professionals. Medical practices, on behalf of the health care professionals who wish to use the App (the users), will register with Google’s Firebase. The practice will then provide each health care professional with a username and password to access the App. Users are referred to Google Firebase's privacy policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy. </p>
